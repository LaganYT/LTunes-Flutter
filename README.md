- Import playlists from XLSX files.

### Downloads

### Lyrics and Visuals

### Bug fixes

- Try and optimize the code so it doesn't take up so much resources (make less laggy)

- Add a setting to disable animation, default = animation on

Fix downloads being so resource heavy (also add a max 3 -changeable in settings - download at a time limit) *** seems like the laggy downloading is only when downloading a playlist, the same amount of songs dont seem to cause lag, add back the search bar to the library (playlists and downloads), fix the audioservice thingy pausing when interrupted by other audio and not letting you unpause from the notification, requiring you to reopen the app to play the music again (greyed out play button on notification)
