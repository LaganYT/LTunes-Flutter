# TODO

## Features
- Add a like song feature
- Add carplay + android auto support 
- Add a place in the library for favorited radio stations (also allow you to favorite radio stations)
- Add: a setting called “Switch source after song completion” meaning it will only switch from one playlist to another playlist it should wait for the current song to finish first

## Search
- Redo the search to show albums and artists in the search itself 
- Add radio stations into this new search system (without need for a different tab to search for them)
- Allow disabling the radio tab in search (maybe?)

## Bug fixes
- Song details not showing up from Barry's phone on his truck via bluetooth
