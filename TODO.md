## Bug Fixes
- Add: Importing of playlists (via XLSX file generated by freeyourmusic - convert the file to json before processing)
- Add: Discord intergration?

Fix: weird scroll up when checking for updates
Fix: When you leave a car and the bluetooth disconnects then get back in the car and reconnect bluetooth it will end the audio session: requiring you to reopen the app from the background to re-start the audio session
Add: when clicking manual for the fetch metadata thing allow pressing custom to type in + import an image for your metadata
Fix: when a song goes to the next have it scroll the lyrics to the top 
Fix: when liking a song dont show the download notification unless it is actually downloading the songs (always exclude local songs)
Fix: in the artists page for the library screen have the artists shown only be artists that are in the library, if it cant find any songs from that artist then dont show the artist
Add: better search bars
Fix?: have all info on the song info page load asynchronously 
Have the artist page (opened from the song page) pre-loaded and pre-caches
Add: allow following an artist to save them to your library, this should replace the old artists page in the library, when clicking an artist from your library’s saved artists have it load the artist page with an option to show “saved songs by -artist name-“ 
Add new sorting methods to the songs list page
Fix the download album/liked songs buttons (show the download button when all songs there are already downloaded)
Fix: when calculating if a song can be downloaded have it check if it’s a local song, if it is then exclude it from the is downloaded part of the is playlist downloaded function 
Fix: allow downloads to work in background, also only show download notifications when app is in background 
Replace: the all downloaded button with remove downloads (which makes the songs from offline to online - deleting the song files) from playlist button
Change: the undo metadata thing to never clear itself
Add: explicit thing in more places, as well as an explicit filter 
Fix: download notification updating on progress change instead of song change
Fix: when radio tab is disabled and its just music and you are offline you get this error instead of the normal offline one: Error loading songs: Null check operator used on a nuill value
Fix weird bobbing from animation on the lyrics (it happens because it tries to center the lyrics but it cant because there isn’t enough space at the top)
Fix album arts not showing up on library page when offline (local files issue most likely)
Have it cache the current recently played stations icons so they show up when offline, it should delete the icon if the station is no longer on the recently played list
Fix playbar sometimes not in sync with full screen player (may be a problem with local files or it not catching up due to waiting on something to finish or lag or something)
Add: a setting to only show your saved songs on your saved albums with an option to show full album
Add: a downloaded indicator for specific songs (playlists, albums, artists, etc)
