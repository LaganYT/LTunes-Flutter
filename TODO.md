# TODO

## UI Improvements
- Show where the song is playing from (playlist or album name) at the top bar next to the show lyrics button
- All overflow text should move back and forth (like Spotify)
- Center text on the albums and playlists on modern library design page
- Increase the playlists, songs, and albums covers to be universally the same size

## Features
- Add a like song feature
- Add a place in the library for favorited radio stations (also allow you to favorite radio stations)
- Add a recently played radio stations quick access (same way as playlists and albums are displayed) on the new library page
- Allow editing playlist names or setting custom playlist icons
- Allow holding on a playlist's icon in the library to show more options (edit, delete, etc)

## Search
- Redo the search to show albums and artists in the search itself 
- Add radio stations into this new search system (without need for a different tab to search for them)
- Allow disabling the radio tab in search (maybe?)
