# TODO

## Search
- Redo the search to show albums and artists in the search itself

## Bug Fixes
- Fix: ios background playback ending after one song when the app is closed which only happens for downloaded songs @https://pub.dev/packages/audio_session/versions/0.1.25 @https://pub.dev/packages/just_audio/versions/0.9.46 @https://pub.dev/packages/audio_service

## Potential Future Features
- try adding podcast support
- test adding the heart and download buttons next to the title/artist of the song
- Add radio stations into this new search system (without need for a different tab to search for them)
