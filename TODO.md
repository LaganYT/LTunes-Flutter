## Development & Infrastructure

- Have the most accurate match for everything be shown first, instead of showing in order of how they are returned from the api

- Go through the audio handler and current song provider and make sure it is as compatiable as possible, I have issues with background audio playback on my ios device sometimes, fix this
- rework the entire download system, i want the check if downloaded, the check if playlist/album is downloaded, and the download system to be reworked
