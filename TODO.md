When scrolling down the song list, fix the icons flickering

When a new song is added to a downloaded playlist have that song auto download - rework how downloaded playlists are handled to achieve this

When you click on an online song and you don’t have signal skip to the next song in context automatically

Fix it so when the device is offline it’ll still play a playlist with a song that isn’t downloaded just skip that song when it comes up

Add touch haptics (disable-able)

Fix bug: LTunes refuses to play a playlist if 1 song is not found, also make sure it doesn’t wait for any online songs to load before loading the current song of a playlist

Remove audio effects: they don’t actually do anything but take more ram

Redesign the sleep timer system, make it more integrated and show the countdown in the full screen player on the appbar section

Synced lyrics shouldn’t change sizes

Make the shuffle and loop icons easier to tell toggle status

When clicking on a song in the songs list it takes forever to start playing, to fix this make sure that the song can play while the rest of the queue 

is still loading, have the queue load in segments that way it doesn’t await for the full queue to load

Experiment with the queue just having song ids and the rest of the info loading dynamically

Redo the listening stats to be a full page with more info
